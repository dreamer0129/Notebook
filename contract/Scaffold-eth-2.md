## Scaffold-eth-2 智能合约开发脚手架

- 基于hardhat 管理智能合约
- next.js 实现前端
- 使用wagmi和viem实现智能合约调用
- zustand 实现客户端状态管理

### Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2, follow the steps below:

1. Install the latest version of Scaffold-ETH 2

```bash
npx create-eth@latest
```

This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies, so it might take a while.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also initialize your project with one of our extensions to add specific features or starter-kits. Learn more in our [extensions documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/extensions/).

2. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```bash
yarn chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network that runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. Learn how to [customize your network configuration](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#1-initialize-a-local-blockchain).

3. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```bash
yarn deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. You can find more information about how to customize your contract and deployment script in our [documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#2-deploy-your-smart-contract).

4. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
